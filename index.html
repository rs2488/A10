  <h1>My Narrative Reflecting on the Ethics of Cookies</h1>
    <p>
       Cookies are small files of data that are stored in your computer. Anytime I visit a website, whether I’m watching a video tutorial on crocheting, reading an article for class, or just window shopping for new clothing, cookies are always quietly working in the background. Cookies collect data and track what you click on, how long you stay on a site, and even what you buy versus don’t buy. If you log in to that site at a later date, the site may be able to greet you by name because you accepted their cookies. It is able to then show you what you browsed last week or remember your login information. It is convenient to be able to resume where you left off, but maybe a little creepy that they are able to track your every move. 

One of the upsides of cookies is the fact that it makes using the internet way more efficient. They help the website to personalize content, save preferences, and make logging in and checking out a breeze. It’s helpful when I’m online doing research for a paper in college, and a site is able to remember what I was looking for and suggest me articles I would be interested in based on that. The downside on the other hand is the lack of transparency. The general population and I don’t fully understand the amount of information that’s being collected and who is is being shared to. It feels a bit invasive especially when very specific and targeted ads start to follow you across platforms based on your past activity that you didn’t think too much about. It feels a bit eerie like you’re constantly being watched. 

The use of cookies is not ALWAYS ethical. It can be ethical to use cookies when your users are informed about what is happening with their data and they are given a choice on whether to opt in or not. Often times, cookie consent pop-ups are vague and have a sense of urgency to just accept and not ask any questions. I don’t think that the cookies' use of pressure and fine-print information is ethical, it feels like manipulation spoon-fed to users and masked as convenience. I believe that if these websites were just honest and upfront about what data they collect and why they collect it and give you an option to opt-out without punishing them with a broken page.</p>
